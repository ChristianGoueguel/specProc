**Pre-release for feedback and experimenting.**

`specProc` package performs a number of pre-processing tasks commonly
used in laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS). Collectively, these
are essential tools in LIBS calibration modeling. These include:

**Multivariate Filtering:**

-   Orthogonal Signal Correction (OSC)
-   Orthogonal partial least-squares (OPLS)
-   Generalized Least Squares Weighting (GLSW)
-   External Parameter Orthogonalization (EPO)

**Robust Methods:**

-   Cellwise & Rowwise outliers detection (CROD)
-   Robust Box-Cox and Yeo-Johnson transformation
-   Skewness-adjusted boxplot
-   Detecting deviating cells (DDC)
-   Robust PCA methods (ROBPCA)
-   Robust PLS method (RSIMPLS)
-   Robust soft independent modelling by class analogy (RSIMCA)

**Miscellaneous:**

-   Multivariate Cluster Elastic Net (MCEN)
-   NIST interactive plot of LIBS emission lines
-   Baseline removal
-   Fitting single, multiple or overlapping peaks
-   Spectra normalization
-   Pearson or Spearman peaks correlation
-   Descriptive statistics such as mean, standard deviation and higher
    central moments
