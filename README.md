**Testing and experimenting.**

The `specProc` package performs a number of preprocessing tasks commonly
used in laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS). Spectral
preprocessing tries to minimize the effect of different types of
distortions on the data. Some preprocessing methods are solely based on
mathematics concepts, others are inspired by the chemical-physical
background of the dataset.
