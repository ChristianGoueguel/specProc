# specProc

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

`specProc` package performs a number of pre-processing tasks commonly
used in the analysis of laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS)
spectra. Collectively, these are essential tools in LIBS calibration
modeling, called chemometrics. These include:

-   Baseline removal
-   Peaks detection
-   Fitting single, multiple or overlapping peaks
-   Normalization
-   Smoothing and filtering
-   Robust or classical Box-Cox transformation
-   Pearson or Spearman peaks correlation
-   Descriptive statistics such as mean, standard deviation and higher
    central moments
-   Statistical tests
-   Rowwise and cellwise outliers detection
-   Robust or classical principal component analysis (PCA)
-   Orthogonal partial-least squares (OPLS)

## Installation

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
