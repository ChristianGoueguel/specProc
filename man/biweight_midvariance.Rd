\usage{
biweight_midvariance(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector.}
}
\value{
The biweight midvariance of the input vector.
}
\description{
This function calculates the biweight midvariance of a numeric vector,
which is a robust measure of scale that can be used to estimate the
variability of the data while being resistant to the influence of outliers.
}
\details{
For scale estimators, the standard deviation (or variance) is the optimal
estimator for Gaussian data. However, it is not resistant and it does not
have robustness of efficiency. In robust statistics, the median absolute
deviation (MAD) is a resistant estimate, but it has only modest robustness
of efficiency, while the biweight midvariance estimator is both resistant
and robust of efficiency.
