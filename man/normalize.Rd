\usage{
normalize(x, method = "area", bkg = NULL, wlength = NULL, drop.na = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric matrix or data frame containing the spectra.}

\item{method}{A character vector specifying the normalization method to apply. Available methods are: "area", "background", and "internal".}

\item{bkg}{A numeric matrix or data frame of the same dimension as \code{x}, specifying the intensity of the continuum radiation (background emission) used for normalizing \code{x}. Required for "background" method.}

\item{wlength}{A character vector of the selected wavelength(s) related to the internal standard(s) peak intensity. Optional for "background" method.}

\item{drop.na}{A logical value indicating whether to remove missing values before normalizing. Default is \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
A data frame of normalized spectra.
}
\description{
This function implements normalization methods based on background,
total area, and internal standard.
}
\details{
The three normalization methods:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Normalization to the background:} Spectra are divided by the intensity
of the background emission. Note that it is recommended that the detector
dark current be subtracted prior to the normalization.
\item \strong{Normalization to the total area:} Each spectrum is divided by the total
area of the spectrum over the whole spectral range. The detector dark current
must be subtracted prior to this normalization. The total area is calculated
as the sum of all intensity levels.
\item \strong{Normalization to an internal standard:} The peak intensity (or area) of the
emission line related to the analyte is divided by the peak intensity (or area)
of a selected emission line related to the internal standard. The internal
standard concentration is assumed constant or known.
