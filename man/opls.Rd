\usage{
opls(X, Y, scale = "center", crossval = 7, permutation = 20)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A data.frame or tibble containing the X-data (predictors).}

\item{Y}{A data.frame or tibble containing the Y-data (responses).}

\item{scale}{A character string indicating the scaling method for the data
("center" or "pareto").}

\item{crossval}{An integer representing the number of cross-validation groups.}

\item{permutation}{An integer representing the number of permutations for
the permutation test.}
}
\value{
A list containing the following components:
\describe{
\item{x_scores}{A matrix of X-scores (the projections of the X-data onto
the predictive components).}
\item{x_loadings}{A matrix of X-loadings (the weights of the original
X-variables on the predictive components).}
\item{x_weights}{A matrix of X-weights (the weights used to calculate
the X-scores).}
\item{orthoScores}{A matrix of orthogonal scores (the projections of
the X-data onto the orthogonal components).}
\item{orthoLoadings}{A matrix of orthogonal loadings (the weights of
the original X-variables on the orthogonal components).}
\item{orthoWeights}{A matrix of orthogonal weights (the weights used
to calculate the orthogonal scores).}
\item{y_weights}{A matrix of Y-weights (the weights used to calculate
the Y-scores).}
\item{y_orthoWeights}{A matrix of orthogonal Y-weights (the weights
used to calculate the orthogonal Y-scores).}
\item{y_scores}{A matrix of Y-scores (the projections of the Y-data
onto the predictive components).}
}
}
\description{
This function fits an Orthogonal Projections to Latent Structures (OPLS)
model to the provided X (predictor) and Y (response) data.
}
\details{
OPLS is a supervised modeling technique used to find the
multidimensional direction in the X-space that explains the maximum
multidimensional variance in the Y-space. It separates the systematic
variation in X into two parts: one that is linearly related to Y
(predictive components) and one that is statistically uncorrelated to the
response variable Y (orthogonal components).
