\usage{
opls(x, y, scale = "center", crossval = 7, permutation = 20)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A data.frame or tibble containing the x-data (predictors).}

\item{y}{A data.frame or tibble containing the y-data (responses).}

\item{scale}{A character string indicating the scaling method for the data
("center" or "pareto").}

\item{crossval}{An integer representing the number of cross-validation groups.}

\item{permutation}{An integer representing the number of permutations for
the permutation test.}
}
\value{
A list containing the following components:
\describe{
\item{x_scores}{A matrix of x-scores (the projections of the x-data onto
the predictive components).}
\item{x_loadings}{A matrix of x-loadings (the weights of the original
x-variables on the predictive components).}
\item{x_weights}{A matrix of x-weights (the weights used to calculate
the x-scores).}
\item{orthoScores}{A matrix of orthogonal scores (the projections of
the x-data onto the orthogonal components).}
\item{orthoLoadings}{A matrix of orthogonal loadings (the weights of
the original x-variables on the orthogonal components).}
\item{orthoWeights}{A matrix of orthogonal weights (the weights used
to calculate the orthogonal scores).}
\item{y_weights}{A matrix of y-weights (the weights used to calculate
the y-scores).}
\item{y_orthoWeights}{A matrix of orthogonal y-weights (the weights
used to calculate the orthogonal y-scores).}
\item{y_scores}{A matrix of y-scores (the projections of the y-data
onto the predictive components).}
}

\description{
This function fits an Orthogonal Projections to Latent Structures (OPLS)
model to the provided x (predictor) and y (response) data.
}
\details{
OPLS is a supervised modeling technique used to find the
multidimensional direction in the x-space that explains the maximum
multidimensional variance in the y-space. It separates the systematic
variation in x into two parts: one that is linearly related to y
(predictive components) and one that is statistically uncorrelated to the
response variable y (orthogonal components).
