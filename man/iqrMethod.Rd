\title{Interquartile Range Method}
\usage{
iqrMethod(x, k = 1.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector.}

\item{k}{A scalar value specifying the fence factor. \code{k = 1.5} is the default and is often considered a conservative choice for identifying outliers.
\code{k = 3} is more lenient and is sometimes used when a higher tolerance for outliers is desired.}
}
\value{
A tibble with two columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{data}: The original numeric values.
\item \code{outlier}: A logical vector indicating whether each value is an outlier or not.
}
}
\description{
This function identifies potential outliers in a numeric vector using the
interquartile range (IQR) method.
}
\details{
This method is robust to the presence of outliers and is suitable for skewed distributions.
Any data points that fall outside the range defined by the lower (Q1 - k × IQR) and upper (Q3 + k × IQR) fences is considered an outlier, where Q1 and Q3 are the 25th and 75th percentiles, respectively.
The fence factor, k, can be adjusted to make the method more or less robust (often 1.5 or 3).
