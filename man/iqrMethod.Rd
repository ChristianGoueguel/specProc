\title{Interquartile Range Method}
\usage{
iqrMethod(x, k = 1.5, skew = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector.}

\item{k}{A numeric value specifying the fence factor. \code{k = 1.5} is the default
as it strikes a balance between sensitivity to mild outliers and robustness against extreme outliers.
\code{k = 3} is more lenient and is sometimes used when a higher tolerance for outliers is desired.}

\item{skew}{A logical value indicating whether to calculate the version of
the fences that accounts for skewness in the underlying data distribution.
By default, \code{skew = FALSE}, which calculates the fences assuming a symmetric distribution.
However, if \code{skew = TRUE}, the formulas used to calculate the lower and upper fences incorporate the medcouple,
to account for potential asymmetry in the underlying data distribution.
These formulas are explicitly derived and optimized for the scenario where \code{k = 1.5} (Hubert and Vandervieren, 2008).
The choice of \code{k = 1.5} offers some robustness against non-normal distributions, including moderate skewness and heavy-tailed behavior.
Consequently, if the user attempts to use a value of \code{k} other than 1.5, the code will issue a warning message indicating that the formula is only defined for \code{k = 1.5}.
In such cases, the code will automatically reset \code{k} to 1.5 and proceed with the calculations using the appropriate formulas and constants.}
}
\value{
A tibble with two columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{data}: The original numeric values.
\item \code{outlier}: A logical vector indicating whether each value is a potential outlier or not.
}
}
\description{
This function identifies potential outliers in a numeric vector using the
interquartile range (IQR) method.
}
\details{
For symmetric distributions, observations that fall outside the range defined
by the lower fence (Q1 - k × IQR) and upper fence (Q3 + k × IQR) are considered as
potential outliers, where Q1 and Q3 are the 25th and 75th percentiles, respectively.
The fence factor can be adjusted to make the method more or less robust
(often 1.5 or 3). Optionally, the method can account for skewness in data
distributions by incorporating the medcouple. In such case, the lower and
upper fences are expressed as functions of the medcouple, adjusting the
fences asymmetrically to better accommodate skewed distributions.
Note that the implemented method does not explicitly account for tail heaviness.
While the medcouple can provide some robustness against heavy tails, the method
may still struggle to accurately identify potential outliers in distributions with extreme
kurtosis or long-tailed behavior.
