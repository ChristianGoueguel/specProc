\title{Classical or Robust Z-Score}
\usage{
zscore(x, robust = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector.}

\item{robust}{A logical value indicating whether to calculate classical or robust (default) z-score.}
}
\value{
A tibble with two columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{data}: The original numeric values.
\item \code{score}: The calculated z-scores.
}
}
\description{
This function is a wrapper around the \code{robustHD} package and calculates classical or robust z-score (standardization) for a numeric vector.
}
\details{
Z-scores are useful for comparing data points from different distributions because they are
dimensionless and standardized. A positive z-score indicates that the data point is above the
mean (or the median in the robust approach), while a negative z-score indicates that the data point is below the mean (or the median). One common rule
to detect outliers using z-scores is the "three-sigma rule", in which data points with an absolute
z-score greater than 3 (|z| > 3) can be considered potential outliers, as they fall outside the range
that covers 99.7\% of the data points in a normal distribution. (Note that a cutoff of |z| > 2.5 is also often used).
