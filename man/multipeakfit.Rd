\usage{
multipeakfit(
  data,
  peaks,
  profiles,
  wL = NULL,
  wG = NULL,
  A = NULL,
  wlgth.min = NULL,
  wlgth.max = NULL,
  id = NULL,
  max.iter = 200
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame of emission spectra}

\item{peaks}{(vector) Center wavelengths of selected peaks}

\item{profiles}{(vector) Lineshape functions}

\item{wL}{(numeric) Lorentzian full width at half maximum (overall initial guess)}

\item{wG}{(numeric) Gaussian full width at half maximum (overall initial guess)}

\item{A}{(numeric) Peak area (overall initial guess)}

\item{wlgth.min}{(numeric) Lower bound of the wavelength subset}

\item{wlgth.max}{(numeric) Upper bound of the wavelength subset}

\item{id}{Spectra name (optional)}

\item{max.iter}{(numeric) Maximum number of iteration (200 by default)}
}
\value{
Fitted value for each peak and the estimated parameters along with the corresponding errors
}
\description{
Fitting of multiple spectral lines by the same or different lineshape functions with variable parameters.
}
\details{
The function uses \code{minpack.lm::nlsLM}, which is based on the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm for searching the minimum value of the square of the sum of the residuals.
