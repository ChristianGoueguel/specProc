\title{Voigt Function}
\usage{
voigt(x, y0, xc, wG, wL, A, real = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector representing the independent variable (e.g., wavelength or frequency).}

\item{y0}{A numeric value specifying the baseline offset.}

\item{xc}{A numeric value representing the center of the peak.}

\item{wG}{A numeric value specifying the Gaussian full width at half maximum (FWHM).}

\item{wL}{A numeric value specifying the Lorentzian FWHM.}

\item{A}{A numeric value representing the peak area.}

\item{real}{A logical value indicating whether to return only the real part
of the Faddeeva function (default is \code{TRUE}).}
}
\value{
A numeric vector containing the values of the Voigt function evaluated
at the provided \code{x} values.
}
\description{
Computes the Voigt function, which is the convolution of a Gaussian function
with a Lorentzian function. This function is commonly used in spectroscopy
to model the line shape of spectral peaks, which often exhibit a combined
Gaussian-Lorentzian profile due to various broadening effects.
}
\details{
The Voigt function is the convolution of a Gaussian function with a Lorentzian
function. It is based on the Faddeeva function, which is the complex convolution
of the two component functions. The Voigt function accurately describes the
line shape resulting from the combined effects of Doppler broadening
(modeled by the Gaussian component) and pressure or natural broadening
(modeled by the Lorentzian component).

Mathematically, the Voigt function is given by:

\deqn{V(x, \sigma_G, \gamma_L) = \frac{A}{\sigma_G \sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp\left(-\frac{(x-x')^2}{2\sigma_G^2}\right) \frac{\gamma_L}{\pi((x'-x_c)^2 + \gamma_L^2)} dx'}

where:
\itemize{
\item \eqn{A} is the peak area
\item \eqn{\sigma_G} is the standard deviation of the Gaussian component
\item \eqn{\gamma_L} is the half-width at half maximum (HWHM) of the Lorentzian component
\item \eqn{x_c} is the center of the peak
