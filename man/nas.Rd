\title{Net Analyte Signal}
\usage{
nas(x, y, ncomp = 2, center = TRUE, scale = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A matrix or data frame of the predictor variables}

\item{y}{A vector, matrix or data frame of the response variable(s)}

\item{ncomp}{An integer specifying the number of principal components to
retain for orthogonal processing. Default is 2.}

\item{center}{A logical value specifying whether to center the data. Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{scale}{A logical value specifying whether to scale the data. Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A tibble containing the corrected predictor variables
}
\description{
This function implements the Net Analyte Signal (NAS) algorithm, as proposed
by Lorber (1997), to remove information from the predictor variables, that is
orthogonal or irrelevant to the response variable(s) by orthogonal projection.
}
\details{
The NAS algorithm aims to obtain a corrected matrix that contains
only the information relevant to the response variable \eqn{\textbf{Y}}. This is achieved
by constructing an orthogonal projection matrix based on the principal
components of the data matrix, \eqn{\textbf{X}}, that are orthogonal to \eqn{\textbf{Y}}. The corrected
matrix is then obtained by projecting \eqn{\textbf{X}} onto the subspace orthogonal
to the unwanted components.
