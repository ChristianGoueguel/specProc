\usage{
pds(x1, x2, win, ncomp, alpha)
}
\arguments{
\item{x1}{A matrix or data frame containing spectra acquired with the standard instrument.}

\item{x2}{A matrix or data frame containing spectra acquired with the instrument to be standardized.}

\item{win}{An integer specifying the half size of the moving window used for PLSR. A larger value may improve the transfer but will increase computational time.}

\item{ncomp}{An integer specifying the number of components to be used in PLSR. Typically, a small number (e.g., 2-5) is sufficient.}

\item{alpha}{A numeric value between 0 and 1 specifying the weight for the global PLSR model. A value of 0 corresponds to the original PDS method, while a value of 1 corresponds to using only the global PLSR model.}
}
\value{
A list with two components:
\item{\code{transfert_matrix}:}{A matrix containing the transfer coefficients.}
\item{i\code{ntercept}:}{A vector containing the intercepts for each local PLSR
model.}
}
\description{
The \code{pds} function performs Piecewise Direct Standardization (PDS), a method
proposed by Bouveresse & Massart (1996) to transfer spectra from
one instrument to another. The main improvement over the original PDS method,
Wang \emph{et al.}, (1991), is the use of a global PLSR model in addition to the local
PLSR models, which can lead to better transfer performance.
