\usage{
robTransform(.data, var = NULL, type = "bestObj", quant = 0.99, nbsteps = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{data frame or tibble.}

\item{var}{vector of selected character or numeric variable(s). Default is \code{NULL} (all columns are selected).}

\item{type}{transformation method to use. Available methods are "BC" (Box-Cox power transformation, which is for strictly positive values.), "YJ" ( Yeo-Johnson power transformation, which works for positive and negative values.) or "bestObj" (both BC and YJ are run for strictly positive variables, and the solution with lowest objective is kept. Whereas if a variable has negative values YJ is run.). Default is "bestObj".}

\item{quant}{numeric value for the quantile used in determining the weights in the re-weighting step (default is 0.99).}

\item{nbsteps}{number of re-weighting steps (2 by default).}
}
\value{
tibble of transformed variable(s), method used ('BC' for Box-Cox and 'YJ' for Yeo-Johnson), objective and lambda.
}
\description{
Transforms each variable in a dataset toward central normality using re-weighted maximum likelihood to robustly fit the Box-Cox or Yeo-Johnson transformation.
}
\details{
Wrapper of the \code{transfo} function from the cellWise package.
