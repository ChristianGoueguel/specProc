\description{
This function implements three orthogonal signal correction (OSC) algorithms, which
are a class of preprocessing techniques designed to minimize, in a set of spectral
data, the systematic variability or noise not directly related to or correlated
with the response vector or property of interest.
}
\details{
The OSC algorithm identifies and removes the orthogonal variation in the input
spectral matrix, \eqn{\textbf{X}}, by iteratively deflating \eqn{\textbf{X}}
with respect to the response vector \eqn{\textbf{y}}. The resulting \eqn{\textbf{X}}-matrix
contains only the variation that is relevant to the \eqn{\textbf{y}}-vector,
which can then be used for further modeling or analysis. This function implements
three different methods for OSC: the original method proposed by Wold \emph{et al.} (1998),
the method proposed by Sjöblom \emph{et al.} (1998), and the method proposed by Fearn (2000).
