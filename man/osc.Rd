osc(
  X,
  Y,

  center = TRUE,
  osc.ncomp = 4,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A matrix or data.frame containing the X-data (predictors).}

\item{Y}{A vector containing the Y-data (response). The length of \code{Y} must
match the number of rows in \code{X}.}

\item{method}{A character string indicating the OSC method to use. Accepted
values are \code{"wold"} (Wold's original method), \code{"sjoblom"} (Sjöblom's method), or
\code{"wise"} (Wise and Gallagher's method).}

\item{center}{A logical value indicating whether to center the X-data before
applying OSC. If \code{TRUE}, the columns of X will be mean-centered.}

\item{osc.ncomp}{An integer representing the number of OSC components to be
calculated. The default value is 4.}

\item{pls.ncomp}{An integer representing the number of PLS components to be
calculated. The default value is 10.}

\item{tol}{A numeric value representing the tolerance for convergence of the
OSC algorithm. The default value is 1e-3.}

\item{iter}{An integer representing the maximum number of iterations for the
OSC algorithm. The default value is 20.}
}
\value{
An list containing the following components:
\describe{
\item{X_corrected}{The corrected X-data after applying OSC.}
\item{scores}{The X-scores after orthogonal variations are removed.}
\item{loadings}{The loadings.}
\item{weights}{The wights.}
\item{R2}{The value of R2}
}
}
\description{
This function applies orthogonal signal correction (OSC) to remove systematic
variation in the X-data (predictors) that is orthogonal (unrelated) to the
Y-data (response). OSC is a preprocessing technique used in chemometrics
and multivariate data analysis to improve the interpretability and predictive
ability of regression models. It is particularly useful when the X-data
contains a large amount of variation that is not relevant to the Y-data,
which can mask the underlying signal of interest and lead to poor model performance.
}
\details{
The OSC algorithm identifies and removes the orthogonal variation in the
X-data by iteratively deflating the X-matrix with respect to the Y-data.
The resulting X-matrix contains only the variation that is relevant to the
Y-data, which can then be used for further modeling or analysis.
This function implements three different methods for OSC: the original
method proposed by Wold et al. (1998), the method proposed by Sjöblom et al.
(1998), and the method proposed by Wise and Gallagher.
