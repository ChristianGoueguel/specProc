\usage{
biweight_midcovariance(x, y)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector.}

\item{y}{A numeric vector of the same length as \code{x}.}
}
\value{
The biweight midcovariance between \code{x} and \code{y}.
}
\description{
This function computes the biweight midcovariance, a robust measure of
covariance between two numerical vectors. The biweight midcovariance is
less sensitive to outliers than the traditional covariance.
}
\examples{
# Example 1: Compute biweight midcovariance for two vectors
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
y <- c(2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
biweight_midcovariance(x, y)

# Example 2: Biweight midcovariance is robust to outliers
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 100)  # An outlier at 100
y <- c(2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
biweight_midcovariance(x, y)
