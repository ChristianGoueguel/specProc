\description{
The Generalized Least Squares Weighting (GLSW) algorithm, proposed by Martens \emph{et al.} (2003),
is a technique used to mitigate the effects of external interferences in datasets.
It constructs a filter to remove these interferences, allowing for more
accurate data analysis and processing.
}
\details{
The algorithm works by first calculating a covariance matrix from the differences
between two spectral datasets that should ideally be similar. These differences are
considered to be the interferences or clutter present in the data.
For example, if two sets of measurements have been taken under similar conditions,
the differences between them could be attributed to external factors such as
sensor noise, environmental conditions, or other sources of interference.
Once the covariance matrix is calculated, GLSW applies a filtering matrix to
down-weight the contributions of the identified interferences or clutter. This
filtering matrix is constructed using a regularization parameter, denoted as
alpha (\eqn{\alpha}).

The value of \eqn{\alpha} determines how strongly the algorithm down-weights
the clutter components in the data. In cases where the interferences are
well-characterized and distinct from the desired signal, a small \eqn{\alpha} value
may be appropriate to achieve effective clutter removal. However, if the
interferences are more subtle or intertwined with the desired signal, a larger
\eqn{\alpha} value may be preferred to avoid over-suppression of the signal itself.

Let \eqn{\textbf{X}} be a data matrix. The GLSW filter is applied as follows:

\deqn{\textbf{X}_{new} = \textbf{X} \cdot \textbf{G}}

where, \eqn{\textbf{X}_{new}} is the filtered matrix and \eqn{\textbf{G}} the filtering matrix.
