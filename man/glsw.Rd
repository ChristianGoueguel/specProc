\title{Generalized Least Squares Weighting}
\usage{
glsw(X1, X2, alpha = 0.01)
}
\arguments{
\item{X1}{A numeric matrix representing the first set of data.}

\item{X2}{A numeric matrix representing the second set of data.}

\item{alpha}{A numeric value specifying the weighting parameter. Default is 0.01.}
}
\value{
A list with the following components:
\describe{
\item{G}{The filtering matrix.}
\item{X1_mc}{The mean-centered \eqn{X_1} matrix.}
\item{X2_mc}{The mean-centered \eqn{X_2} matrix.}
}
}
\description{
This function implements the Generalized Least Squares Weighting (GLSW) algorithm
proposed by Geladi and Kowalski (1986). The GLSW algorithm is used for calibration
transfer, classification, and regression applications. It calculates a covariance
matrix from the differences between similar samples and applies a filtering matrix
to down-weight correlations present in the original covariance matrix.

The choice of the weighting parameter \eqn{\alpha} depends on the scale of the original values
and the similarity between the interferences and the net analyte signal. Typical values range
from 1 to 0.0001.
