\title{Biweight Midcorrelation}
\usage{
biweight_midcorrelation(x, y)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector.}

\item{y}{A numeric vector of the same length as \code{x}.}
}
\value{
The biweight midcorrelation between \code{x} and \code{y}.
}
\description{
This function computes the biweight midcorrelation between two numeric vectors.
The biweight midcorrelation is a robust measure of correlation that is less
sensitive to outliers than the traditional Pearson's correlation coefficient.
}
\details{
The biweight midcorrelation is calculated using the biweight midvariances
and biweight midcovariance, as described by Wilcox (1994).
}
\examples{
x <- rnorm(100)
y <- 2 * x + rnorm(100)
