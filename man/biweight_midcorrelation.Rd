\usage{
biweight_midcorrelation(X, Y)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric vector.}

\item{Y}{A numeric vector of the same length as X.}
}
\value{
The biweight midcorrelation between X and Y.
}
\description{
This function computes the biweight midcorrelation between two numeric vectors.
The biweight midcorrelation is a robust measure of correlation that is less
sensitive to outliers than the traditional Pearson correlation coefficient.
}
\details{
The biweight midcorrelation is calculated using the biweight midvariances
and biweight midcovariance, as described in the following paper:

Wilcox, R. R. (1994). The Biweight Midcorrelation: A Robust Correlation
Technique for Two Samples. Journal of Statistical Computation and Simulation,
48(2), 103-110.

\examples{
x <- rnorm(100)
y <- 2 * x + rnorm(100)
biweight_midcorrelation(x, y)
