\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric matrix or data frame representing the predictor variables.}

\item{y}{A numeric vector, matrix or data frame representing the response variables.}

\item{ncomp}{An integer representing the number of components. Default value is 10.}

\value{
A list containing the following components:
\itemize{
\item \code{correction}: The corrected matrix.
\item \code{scores}: The orthogonal scores matrix.
\item \code{loadings}: The orthogonal loadings matrix.
\item \code{weights}: The weights matrix.

\description{
This function implements the modified orthogonal projections to latent
structures (O2PLS) algorithm as proposed by Trygg (2002). The OPLS and O2PLS
methods differ as follows: OPLS is unidirectional \eqn{(X \Rightarrow Y)},
meaning that only orthogonal variations in the \eqn{X}-space are filtered out.
Whilst O2PLS is bi-directional \eqn{(X \Leftrightarrow Y)}, meaning that
orthogonal variations in both the \eqn{X}- and \eqn{Y}-space are filtered out.
}
\details{
The O2PLS method handles situations where systematic \eqn{X}-orthogonal variation
in \eqn{Y} exists, and it is predictive in both ways, \eqn{(X \Rightarrow Y)}
and \eqn{(Y \Rightarrow X)}. O2PLS uses least squares regression to estimate
the pure constituent profiles and divide the systematic part in \eqn{X} and
\eqn{Y} into two parts, one which is related to both \eqn{X} and \eqn{Y}
(covarying) and one that is not (orthogonal).
