}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric matrix or data frame representing the predictor variables.}

\item{y}{A numeric matrix or data frame representing the response variables.}

\item{ncomp}{An integer representing the number of components. Default value is 10.}

\item{center}{A logical value indicating whether to mean-centered \code{x} and \code{y}. Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{scale}{A logical value indicating whether to scale \code{x} and \code{y}. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\value{
An list containing the following components:
\itemize{
\item \code{correction}: The corrected matrix.
\item \code{scores}: The orthogonal scores matrix.
\item \code{loadings}: The orthogonal loadings matrix.
\item \code{weights}: The weights matrix.

\description{
Implements the O2PLS (Orthogonal to Partial Least Squares) algorithm.

\details{
The O2-PLS method handles situations where systematic X-orthogonal variation
in Y exists, and it is predictive in both ways, X → Y and Y → X. The basic
idea of O2-PLS is (a) to use multiple linear regression to estimate the pure
constituent profiles and (b) to divide the systematic part in X and Y into
two parts, one which is related to both X and Y (covarying) and one that is
not (orthogonal). For each matrix the latter is computed in a way that makes
it orthogonal to the other matrix, i.e. linearly independent. Thus the O2-PLS
model can be written as a factor analysis model where some factors (T) are
common to both X and Y.
