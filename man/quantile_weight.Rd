\title{Quantile Tail Weight Measure}
\usage{
quantile_weight(x, p = 0.25, q = 0.75, drop.na = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector.}

\item{p}{A numeric value between 0 and 0.5 (\code{p = 0.25} by default).}

\item{q}{A numeric value between 0.5 and 1 (\code{q = 0.75} by default).}

\item{drop.na}{Logical value indicating whether to remove missing values (NA) or not.}
}
\value{
A tibble with two numeric columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{LQW}: Left quantile weight.
\item \code{RQW}: Right quantile weight.
}
}
\description{
This function calculates the left quantile weight (LQW) and the right
quantile weight (RQW) for a given numeric vector. These weights serve as
robust measures of tail heaviness, providing insights into the distribution's
behavior in the left and right tails, respectively.
}
\details{
The quantile weights, comprising the left quantile weight (LQW) and the right
quantile weight (RQW), are robust measures of tail weight in probability
distributions. They have a breakdown value of 12.5\%, meaning that they are
resistant to the influence of up to 12.5\% of outliers or contaminated data.

The concept of quantile weights is derived from quartile skewness, introduced
by D.V. Hinkley in 1975. Quartile skewness measures the skewness or asymmetry
of a distribution by comparing the differences between the quartiles, which
are robust measures of location and scale.

Specifically, the quantile weights are calculated when applying quartile
skewness to either the left half or the right half of the probability mass,
divided at the median of the univariate distribution. The left quantile weight
(LQW) is the proportion of the data below the median, divided by the expected
proportion (0.5) if the data were normally distributed. The right quantile
weight (RQW) is the proportion of the data above the median, divided by 0.5.

Interpretation of Quantile Weights:
\itemize{
\item Values closer to 0 indicate lighter tails compared to the normal distribution.
\item Values closer to 1 signify heavier tails compared to the normal distribution.
\item Values significantly greater than 1 suggest the presence of outliers or
extreme values in the respective tail.
