\title{Quantile Tail Weight Measure}
\usage{
quantile_weight(x, p = 0.25, q = 0.75, drop.na = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector.}

\item{p}{A numeric value between 0 and 0.5 (\code{p = 0.25} by default).}

\item{q}{A numeric value between 0.5 and 1 (\code{q = 0.75} by default).}

\item{drop.na}{Logical value indicating whether to remove missing values (NA) or not.}
}
\value{
A tibble with two numeric columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{LQW}: Left quantile weight.
\item \code{RQW}: Right quantile weight.
}
}
\description{
The function calculates the left quantile weight (LQW) and the right quantile
weight (RQW) for a given numeric vector. Values closer to 0 indicate lighter
tails, while values closer to 1 signify heavier tails.
}
\details{
The quantile weights are a robust measure of tail weight in probability
distributions (breakdown value of 12.5\%). They are derived from the concept of quartile skewness,
introduced by D.V. Hinkley in 1975. Quartile skewness measures the skewness
or asymmetry of a distribution by comparing the differences between the quartiles.
Specifically, the quantile weights are calculated when applying quartile skewness
to either the left half or the right half of the probability mass, divided at
the median of the univariate distribution.
