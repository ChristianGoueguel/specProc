\usage{
whittaker(x, lambda = 1000, p = 0.001, max.iter = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric matrix or data frame.}

\item{lambda}{A numeric value specifying the smoothing parameter, which
controls the amount of curvature allowed for the baseline. The smaller the
lambda, the more curvature in the baseline fitting. Default is 1000.}

\item{p}{A numeric value specifying the extent of asymmetry required of the
fit. Larger values allow more negative-going regions. Smaller values disallow
negative-going regions. \code{p} must be between 0 and 1. Default is 0.001.}

\item{max.iter}{Maximum number of iterations for the algorithm. Default is 10.}
}
\value{
A list containing two tibbles:
\itemize{
\item \code{correction}: The baseline-corrected spectral matrix.
\item \code{background}: The fitted background emission.
}
}
\description{
Baseline correction based on asymmetric least squares (ALS) algorithm
as proposed by Eilers \emph{et al.} (2005).
}
\details{
The function applies Eilers' method based on a Whittaker filter. The algorithm
estimates a baseline curve by minimizing the asymmetric least squares criterion,
which allows for different weights for positive and negative residuals. The
resulting baseline curve is subtracted from the input data, providing a
baseline-corrected version.
