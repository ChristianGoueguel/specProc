\usage{
correlation(
  .data,
  response_var,
  method = "pearson",
  .plot = FALSE,
  .color = "#111D71",
  .interactive = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{A data frame or tibble containing the variables of interest.}

\item{response_var}{A character string specifying the name of the response variable.}

\item{method}{A character string indicating the correlation method to use. Allowed values are
"pearson", "spearman", "kendall", "chatterjee", or "bicor" (for biweight midcorrelation).
The default is "pearson".}

\item{.plot}{A logical value indicating whether to produce a visualization of the correlations.
Default is FALSE (no plot).}

\item{.color}{A character string specifying the color to use for the plot. Default is "#111D71".}

\item{.interactive}{A logical value indicating whether to create an interactive plot using
plotly. Default is FALSE (static ggplot2 plot).}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item \verb{$.correlation}: A tibble with columns for the variable name, correlation value, and method used.
\item \verb{$.plot}: If \code{.plot = TRUE}, a \code{ggplot2} object (or a \code{plotly} object if \code{.interactive = TRUE}).
}

\description{
Computes various correlation coefficients between a specified response variable
and each of the remaining variables in a given data frame or tibble. The available correlation
methods are Pearson's product-moment correlation (parametric), Spearman's rank correlation,
Kendall's tau correlation (non-parametric), Chatterjee's new correlation coefficient, and
the biweight midcorrelation (a robust correlation measure).
}
\details{
The Pearson correlation coefficient measures the linear relationship between two continuous
variables and is suitable when the data follows a bivariate normal distribution. The Spearman
and Kendall correlations are non-parametric measures of monotonic association, making them
suitable for non-linear relationships and when the data deviates from normality.
The Chatterjee correlation coefficient is a recently proposed measure that aims to address
some limitations of existing correlation coefficients, particularly for heavy-tailed
distributions and in the presence of outliers. The biweight midcorrelation is
a robust correlation measure that downweights the influence of outliers and is
recommended when the data contains extreme values or deviates significantly
from normality.
