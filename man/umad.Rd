\title{Unbiased Median Absolute Deviation}
\usage{
umad(x, drop.na = TRUE, method = "hayes")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector.}

\item{drop.na}{A logical value indicating whether to remove missing values
(NA) from the calculations. If \code{TRUE} (the default), missing values will be
removed. If \code{FALSE}, missing values will be included.}

\item{method}{A character string specifying the method to use for calculating
the correction factor when the number of sample is more than 100. The available
options are "hayes" (default) and "williams".}
}
\value{
The MAD scale estimate for the input vector \code{x}.
}
\description{
This function calculates the Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) scale
estimator for a numeric vector, using the Park-Kim-Wang approach. The method
adds a small sample correction factor to make MAD unbiased at the normal distribution.
}
\details{
The correction factor, \eqn{C}, is calculated differently based on the sample size \eqn{n}:
\itemize{
\item For \eqn{n > 100}, \eqn{C} is calculated using an analytical approximation
proposed by either Hayes (2014) or Williams (2011).
\item For \eqn{n \leq 100}, \eqn{C} is obtained from a pre-computed table of
values proposed by Park \emph{et al.} (2020).
