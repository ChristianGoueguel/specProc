\usage{
plotSpec(data, id = NULL, colvar = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame of emission spectra.}

\item{id}{Factor variable that identified each spectrum  (\code{NULL} by default).}

\item{colvar}{Numeric variable to be display in color scale (\code{NULL} by default).}
}
\value{
ggplot object.

\description{
Spectrum plots are commonly xâ€“y plots in which the x-axis represents the wavelength and the y-axis represents intensity of a spectrum's signal.
The function allows to plot a spectrum or several spectra in a single plot, identified either by an id (for example, the samples or spectra id) or by a target variable (for example, the concentration of a chemical element) .
}
\details{
This function is based on the ggplot2 package, thus allowing users to easily add or modify different components of the plot.
