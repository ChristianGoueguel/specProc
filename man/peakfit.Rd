\arguments{
\item{.data}{Data frame of emission spectra}

\item{profile}{(character) Lineshape function: "lorentzian", "gaussian" or "voigt"}

\item{wL}{(numeric) Lorentzian full width at half maximum (initial guess)}

\item{wG}{(numeric) Gaussian full width at half maximum (initial guess)}

\item{A}{(numeric) Peak area (initial guess)}

\item{wlgth.min}{(numeric) Lower bound of the wavelength subset}

\item{wlgth.max}{(numeric) Upper bound of the wavelength subset}

\item{id}{Spectra name (optional)}

\item{max.iter}{(numeric) Maximum number of iteration (200 by default)}
}
\value{
Fitted value and the estimated parameters along with the corresponding errors
}
\description{
Fitting of a single spectral line by lineshape functions with variable parameters.
}
\details{
The function uses \code{minpack.lm::nlsLM}, which is based on the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm for searching the minimum value of the square of the sum of the residuals.
