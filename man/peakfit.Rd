\title{Spectral Fitting}
\usage{
peakfit(data, profile = "Voigt", wlgth.min = NULL, wlgth.max = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame of emission spectra}

\item{profile}{Line shape functions (Lorentzian, Gaussian and Voigt)}

\item{wlgth.min}{The lower bound of the wavelength subset}

\item{wlgth.max}{The upper bound of the wavelength subset}
}
\value{
Fitted value and estimated parameters
}
\description{
Fitting of spectroscopic peak by line shape functions with variable parameters.
}
\details{
The function uses \code{minpack.lm::nlsLM}, which is based on the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm for searching the minimum value of the square of the sum of the residuals.
