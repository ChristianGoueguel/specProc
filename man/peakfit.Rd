\usage{
peakfit(
  data,
  profile = "Voigt",
  wL = NULL,
  wG = NULL,
  A = NULL,
  wlgth.min = NULL,
  wlgth.max = NULL,
  id = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame of emission spectra}

\item{profile}{Line shape function: "Lorentzian", "Gaussian" or "Voigt"}

\item{wL}{Lorentzian full width at half maximum (initial guess)}

\item{wG}{Gaussian full width at half maximum (initial guess)}

\item{A}{Peak area (initial guess)}

\item{wlgth.min}{Lower bound of the wavelength subset}

\item{wlgth.max}{Upper bound of the wavelength subset}

\item{id}{spectra identification (optional)}
}
\value{
Fitted value and the estimated parameters along with the corresponding errors
}
\description{
Fitting of spectroscopic peak by line shape functions with variable parameters.
}
\details{
The function uses \code{minpack.lm::nlsLM}, which is based on the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm for searching the minimum value of the square of the sum of the residuals.
