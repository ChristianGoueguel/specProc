\title{Fast Average for Large Spectral Dataset}
\usage{
average(x, .group_by = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A data frame or tibble.}

\item{.group_by}{The column name to group the data by (optional).
If not provided, the average of the overall data will be computed.}
}
\value{
\itemize{
\item If \code{.group_by = NULL}, the function returns a numeric vector containing the
mean of each column across all spectra.
\item If \code{.group_by} is provided, the function returns a data frame with columns corresponding
to the unique values in the grouping column. Each cell contains the mean of the corresponding
column for that group.
}
}
\description{
This function efficiently averages the samples spectra in a large
dataset. It provides flexibility by computing either the overall
mean across all spectra or group-wise means based on the values of a
specified grouping column.
}
\details{
The function leverages the power of \code{Rcpp} to perform the mean calculations
in C++. The underlying C++ implementation has a time complexity of
\emph{O(n × m)}, where \emph{n} is the number of rows and \emph{m} is
the number of columns in the data. This efficient implementation ensures that
the function can handle large datasets without significant performance overhead.

The R wrapper function adds minimal overhead for argument checking and data manipulation,
while leveraging the efficient C++ implementation for the core computations. The overall
time complexity remains \emph{O(n × m)}.
