\title{Fast Column-wise Average for Large Datasets}
\usage{
average(.data, .group_by = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{A data frame or tibble.}

\item{.group_by}{The column name to group the data by (optional).
If not provided, the average of the overall data will be computed.}
}
\value{
A tibble of the computed averages, with one row for each group
(if grouped) or a single row with the overall column averages (if not grouped).
}
\description{
This function calculates the column-wise average values of numeric
columns in a data frame or tibble. It provides flexibility by allowing users
to compute either the overall column means or group-wise column means based
on the values of a specified grouping column.
}
\details{
The function uses the package \code{Rcpp} to perform the mean calculations efficiently in C++.
The underlying C++ function has a time complexity of \emph{O(n × m)}, where \emph{n} is the number
of rows and \emph{m} is the number of columns in the data. This efficient
implementation ensures that the function can handle reasonably large datasets
without significant performance overhead. While the R wrapper function adds
some minimal overhead for argument checking and data manipulation,
the overall time complexity remains \emph{O(n × m)}, ensuring scalability and
efficient computation even for large datasets.
