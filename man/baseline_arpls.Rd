\usage{
baseline_arpls(x, lambda = 1000, ratio = 0.05, max.iter = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric matrix or data frame.}

\item{lambda}{A numeric value specifying the smoothing parameter, which
controls the amount of curvature allowed for the baseline. The smaller the
lambda, the more curvature in the baseline fitting. Default is 1000.}

\item{ratio}{A numeric value specifying the convergence ratio for the
iterative algorithm. The algorithm stops when the relative change in the
weights is less than this ratio. Typical values are between 0.01 and 0.1.
Default is 0.05.}

\item{max.iter}{Maximum number of iterations for the algorithm. Default is 10.}
}
\value{
A list containing two tibbles:
\itemize{
\item \code{correction}: The baseline-corrected spectral matrix.
\item \code{background}: The fitted background emission.
}
}
\description{
Baseline correction based on asymmetrically reweighted penalized least
squares smoothing algorithm as proposed by Baek \emph{et al.} (2015).
}
\details{
The algorithm estimates a baseline curve by iteratively updating weights based
on the residuals and minimizing a penalized least squares criterion. The
resulting baseline curve is subtracted from the input data, providing a
baseline-corrected version.
