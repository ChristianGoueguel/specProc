- title: Multivariate filtering
  desc: >
    Multivariate filters are used to identify and remove unwanted covariance
    structures and sources of variance from the data. The resulting data retains
    only the covariance patterns deemed useful or interesting for modeling purposes.

- title: Peak fitting
  desc: >
    Peak fitting is employed to characterize spectral lines.
    The choice of the fitting function depends on the specific broadening
    mechanisms and physical conditions of the emitting environment.
