- title: Univariate filtering
  desc: >
  Univariate filters are used in data preprocessing to handle individual variables
  or features independently. Univariate filters can be employed to explore issues
  such as outliers and missing values.

- title: Multivariate filtering
  desc: >
  Multivariate filters play a crucial role in data preprocessing by helping
  identify and remove unwanted covariance structures and sources of variance
  from the data. These filters can be conceptualized as pattern filters, where
  the resulting data retains only the covariance patterns deemed useful or
  interesting for modeling purposes.

- title: Peak fitting
  desc: >
  Peak fitting is employed to characterize spectral lines.
  The choice of the fitting function (e.g., Gaussian, Lorentzian or Voigt) depends
  on the specific broadening mechanisms and physical conditions of the emitting
  environment.
