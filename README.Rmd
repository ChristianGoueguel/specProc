### LIBS spectrum in the 375â€“510 nm wavelength range

The plot below shows a typical LIBS spectrum. Prominent atomic and ionic emission lines of Ca, Mn and Ba were identified using the [NIST spectral lines database](https://www.nist.gov/pml/atomic-spectra-database). The spectrum show emission lines of Ca II 393.37 nm, Ca II 396.85 nm and Ca I 422.67 nm, unresolved Mn triplet at 403.08, 403.31 and 403.45 nm, and Ba ionic lines at 455.40 and 493.41 nm.

```{r include=FALSE}
data("Ca_Mn_spec")
```

```{r include=FALSE}
plot1 <- plotSpec(Ca_Mn_spec) + theme_classic(base_size = 8)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=2, fig.width=4}
plot1 +
  annotate("text", x = 391, y = 4.2e4, angle = 90, size = 2, label = "Ca II 393.37 nm") +
  annotate("text", x = 396, y = 3e4, angle = 90, size = 2, label = "Ca II 396.85 nm") +
  annotate("text", x = 401, y = 3.8e4, angle = 90, size = 2, label = "Mn I 403-nm") +
  annotate("text", x = 420, y = 3.5e4, angle = 90, size = 2, label = "Ca I 422.67 nm") +
  annotate("text", x = 453, y = 3e4, angle = 90, size = 2, label = "Ba II 455.40 nm") +
  annotate("text", x = 491, y = 1.5e4, angle = 90, size = 2, label = "Ba II 493.41 nm")
```

### Baseline removal

When analyzing LIBS spectra, it is often more effective to subtract an
estimated baseline from the data. The estimate is constructed by fitting a low-order polynomial function to the spectrum baseline. Then the resulting curve fit is subtracted from the data. Here we use the function `baselinerm` to perform such a task.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
baseline_fit <- Ca_Mn_spec %>%
  select(`390.03027`:`500.03397`) %>%
  baselinerm(degree = 7)
```

As one can see, the `baselinerm` function provides a list containing two data frames, one for the baseline-subtracted spectrum or spectra `spec` and the other for the fitted baseline `bkg`.

```{r}
str(baseline_fit, list.len = 5) 
```

We can then extract each data frame from the list using the `purrr::pluck` function.

```{r}
background <- baseline_fit %>% pluck("bkg")
corrected_spec <- baseline_fit %>% pluck("spec")
```

```{r include=FALSE}
background %<>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = everything(), 
    names_to = "wavelength", 
    values_to = "intensity"
    ) %>%
  modify_at("wavelength", as.numeric)
```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
plot2 <- Ca_Mn_spec %>%
  plotSpec() +
  geom_line(data = background, aes(x = wavelength, y = intensity), colour = "red")

plot3 <-corrected_spec %>% 
  plotSpec() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, colour = "red")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
plot2 | plot3
```

### Peaks fitting

Fitting of laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) spectral lines is
very important for accurate quantitative analysis. As such, the
Gaussian, Lorentzian and Voigt profile functions are often used to fit
these spectral lines. The idea of curve fitting is to find a mathematical model that fits the spectral lines. It is assumed that you have theoretical or experimental reasons for picking a function of a certain profile. The `peakfit` function finds the specific parameters which make that function match your data as closely as possible. 

`peakfit` is based on the `minpack.lm::nlsLM` function that uses the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm for searching the minimum value of the square of the sum of the residuals. The search process involves starting with an initial guess at the parameters values.

Let's start with the fit of a single peak first. Here we want to fit separately the Ba II line at 455.40 nm, then the Ca I line at 422.67 nm, using the Gaussian profile `profile = "Gaussian"`.The Gaussian profile was chosen because we expect to have a relatively large spectral linewidth due to the measurement conditions. Moreover, `wG` and `A` are our initial guess and are respectively the Gaussian full width at half maximum (FWHM) and peak area.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
Ba455_fit <- Ca_Mn_spec %>% 
  select(`454.09686`:`457.09573`) %>% 
  peakfit(profile = "Gaussian", wG = 1, A =  15000)
```

```{r}
Ca422_fit <- Ca_Mn_spec %>% 
  select(`421.65463`:`424.10825`) %>% 
  peakfit(profile = "Gaussian", wG = 1, A = 15000)
```

The `peakfit` function returns a list containing data stored in `augmented` and in `tidied`. For instance, using results from the Ba line fitting, we can see that `augmented` contains the original data `x` (wavelength) and `y` (intensity) and the fitted results `.fitted` along with the corresponding residuals `.resid`.  

```{r}
Ba455_fit %>% pluck("augmented")
```

While `tidied` contains the estimated parameters.

```{r}
Ba455_fit %>% pluck("tidied")
```

Thus we can plot the obtained results, since a picture is worth a thousand words. 

```{r include=FALSE}
plot4 <- Ba455_fit %>%
  pluck("augmented") %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y), size = 3, colour = "black", shape = 21) +
  geom_line(aes(x = x, y = .fitted), size = 1, colour = "red", linetype = "solid") +
  labs(subtitle = "Ba II 455.40 nm", x = "Wavelength [nm]", y = "Intensity [arb. units]") +
  theme_bw(base_size = 10)

plot5 <- Ba455_fit %>%
  pluck("augmented") %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = .resid)) + 
  geom_point(shape = 21, size = 2, fill = "blue") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +
  labs(x = "Wavelength [nm]", y = "Residual") +
  theme_bw(base_size = 10)
```

```{r include=FALSE}
plot6 <- Ca422_fit %>%
  pluck("augmented") %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y), size = 3, colour = "black", shape = 21) +
  geom_line(aes(x = x, y = .fitted), size = 1, colour = "red", linetype = "solid") +
  labs(subtitle = "Ca I 422.67 nm", x = "Wavelength [nm]", y = "Intensity [arb. units]") +
  theme_bw(base_size = 10)

plot7 <- Ca422_fit %>%
  pluck("augmented") %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = .resid)) + 
  geom_point(shape = 21, size = 2, fill = "blue") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +
  labs(x = "Wavelength [nm]", y = "Residual") +
  theme_bw(base_size = 10)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
(plot4 / plot5) + plot_layout(ncol = 1, heights = c(5, 1)) |
  (plot6 / plot7) + plot_layout(ncol = 1, heights = c(5, 1))
```

In fact, we should rather look at the Voigt profile, especially if we want to have an accurate measurement of the width of the emission lines. In this case, the `wL` estimate provides the width of the spectral lines while the `wG` estimate provides the instrumental broadening.   

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
Ba455_fit2 <- Ca_Mn_spec %>% 
  select(`454.09686`:`457.09573`) %>% 
  peakfit(profile = "Voigt", wL = 0.1, wG = 0.9, A =  15000)
```

```{r}
Ca422_fit2 <- Ca_Mn_spec %>% 
  select(`421.65463`:`424.10825`) %>% 
  peakfit(profile = "Voigt", wL = 0.1, wG = 0.9, A = 15000)
```

We see below that, as expected, Gaussian broadening accounts for most of the broadening of the barium emission line.  

```{r}
Ba455_fit2 %>% pluck("tidied")
```

```{r include=FALSE}
plot8 <- Ba455_fit2 %>%
  pluck("augmented") %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y), size = 3, colour = "black", shape = 21) +
  geom_line(aes(x = x, y = .fitted), size = 1, colour = "red", linetype = "solid") +
  labs(subtitle = "Ba II 455.40 nm", x = "Wavelength [nm]", y = "Intensity [arb. units]") +
  theme_bw(base_size = 10)

plot9 <- Ba455_fit2 %>%
  pluck("augmented") %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = .resid)) + 
  geom_point(shape = 21, size = 2, fill = "blue") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +
  labs(x = "Wavelength [nm]", y = "Residual") +
  theme_bw(base_size = 10)
```

```{r include=FALSE}
plot10 <- Ca422_fit2 %>%
  pluck("augmented") %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y), size = 3, colour = "black", shape = 21) +
  geom_line(aes(x = x, y = .fitted), size = 1, colour = "red", linetype = "solid") +
  labs(subtitle = "Ca I 422.67 nm", x = "Wavelength [nm]", y = "Intensity [arb. units]") +
  theme_bw(base_size = 10)

plot11 <- Ca422_fit2 %>%
  pluck("augmented") %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = .resid)) + 
  geom_point(shape = 21, size = 2, fill = "blue") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +
  labs(x = "Wavelength [nm]", y = "Residual") +
  theme_bw(base_size = 10)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
(plot8 / plot9) + plot_layout(ncol = 1, heights = c(5, 1)) |
  (plot10 / plot11) + plot_layout(ncol = 1, heights = c(5, 1))
