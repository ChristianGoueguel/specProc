**Pre-release for feedback and experimenting.**

`specProc` package performs a number of preprocessing tasks commonly
used in laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS). Spectral
preprocessing try to minimise the effect of different types of
distortions on the data. Some preprocessing methods are solely based on
mathematics concepts, others are inspired by the chemical-physical
background of the data and the problem.

**Functions avaliable:**
