**Pre-release for feedback and experimenting.**

`specProc` package performs a number of preprocessing tasks commonly
used in spectral data analysis. Some preprocessing
methods are solely based on mathematics concepts, others are inspired by
the chemical-physical background of the data and the problem.

-   Orthogonal signal correction
-   Orthogonal partial least-squares
-   Generalized least squares weighting
-   External parameter orthogonalization
-   Cellwise & rowwise outliers detection
-   Robust Box-Cox and Yeo-Johnson transformation
-   Skewness-adjusted boxplot
-   Baseline removal
-   Fitting single, multiple or overlapping peaks
-   Spectra normalization
-   Pearson, Spearman and Kendall correlation
-   Descriptive statistics such as mean, standard deviation and higher central moments

## Installation

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
