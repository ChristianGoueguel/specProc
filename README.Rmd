### LIBS spectrum in the 375–510 nm wavelength range

The plot below shows a typical LIBS spectrum. Prominent atomic and ionic
emission lines of Ca, Mn and Ba were identified using the [NIST spectral
lines database](https://www.nist.gov/pml/atomic-spectra-database). The
spectrum show emission lines of Ca II 393.37 nm, Ca II 396.85 nm and Ca
I 422.67 nm, unresolved Mn triplet at 403.08, 403.31 and 403.45 nm, and
Ba ionic lines at 455.40 and 493.41 nm.

```{r}
data("Ca_Mn_spec")
```

```{r fig.height=2, fig.width=4}
Ca_Mn_spec %>% 
  plotSpec() + 
  theme_classic(base_size = 8) +
  annotate("text", x = 391, y = 4.2e4, angle = 90, size = 2, label = "Ca II 393.37 nm") +
  annotate("text", x = 396, y = 3e4, angle = 90, size = 2, label = "Ca II 396.85 nm") +
  annotate("text", x = 401, y = 3.8e4, angle = 90, size = 2, label = "Mn I 403-nm") +
  annotate("text", x = 420, y = 3.5e4, angle = 90, size = 2, label = "Ca I 422.67 nm") +
  annotate("text", x = 453, y = 3e4, angle = 90, size = 2, label = "Ba II 455.40 nm") +
  annotate("text", x = 491, y = 1.5e4, angle = 90, size = 2, label = "Ba II 493.41 nm")
```

Note that we used the ggplot-based `plotSpec` function to generate the
above plot.

### Baseline removal

When analyzing LIBS spectra, it is often more effective to subtract an
estimated baseline from the data. The estimate is constructed by fitting
a low-order polynomial function to the spectrum baseline. Then the
resulting curve fit is subtracted from the data. Here we use the
function `baselinerm` to perform such a task.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
baseline_fit <- Ca_Mn_spec %>%
  select(`390.03027`:`500.03397`) %>%
  baselinerm(degree = 7)
```

As one can see, the `baselinerm` function provides a list containing two
data frames, one for the baseline-subtracted spectrum or spectra `spec`
and the other for the fitted baseline `bkg`.

```{r}
str(baseline_fit, list.len = 5) 
```

We can then extract each data frame from the list using the
`purrr::pluck` function.

```{r}
background <- baseline_fit %>% pluck("bkg")
corrected_spec <- baseline_fit %>% pluck("spec")
```

And then visualize the spectrum before and after baseline removal.

```{r fig.height=3, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
Ca_Mn_spec %>% 
  plotSpec() + 
  geom_line(
    data = background %>% 
      pivot_longer(cols = everything(), names_to = "wavelength", values_to = "intensity") %>%
      modify_at("wavelength", as.numeric), 
    aes(x = wavelength, y = intensity), 
    colour = "red"
    ) | 
  corrected_spec %>% 
  plotSpec() + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, colour = "red")
```

### Peak fitting

Fitting of laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) spectral lines is
very important for accurate quantitative analysis. As such, the
Gaussian, Lorentzian and Voigt profile functions are often used to fit
these spectral lines. The idea of curve fitting is to find a
mathematical model that fits the spectral lines. It is assumed that you
have theoretical or experimental reasons for picking a function of a
certain profile. The `peakfit` function finds the specific parameters
which make that function match your data as closely as possible.

The `peakfit` function uses the full width at half maximum (FWHM)
version of the Gaussian function implemented in `gaussian_func` and
given by the following expression:

<p align="center">
<img src="images/GaussianFun.png" width="269"/>
</p>

The Lorentzian function implemented in `lorentzian_func` has a much
wider tails than the Gaussian function and is given by:

<p align="center">
<img src="images/LorentzianFun.png" width="238"/>
</p>

`peakfit` uses the Pseudo-Voigt function, `voigt_func`, which is an
approximation of the Voigt function, defined as the convolution of
Gaussian and Lorentzian function. Thus the Pseudo-Voigt function can be
expressed as:

<p align="center">
<img src="images/VoigtFun.png" width="541"/>
</p>

`peakfit` is based on the `minpack.lm::nlsLM` function that uses the
Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm for searching the minimum value of the
square of the sum of the residuals. The search process involves starting
with an initial guess at the parameters values.

Let's start with the fit of a single peak first. Here we want to fit
separately the Ba II line at 455.40 nm, then the Ca I line at 422.67 nm,
using the Gaussian profile `profile = "Gaussian"`.The Gaussian profile
was chosen because we expect to have a relatively large spectral
linewidth due to the measurement conditions. Moreover, `wG` and `A` are
our initial guess and are respectively the Gaussian FWHM and peak area.
There are two ways to limit the wavelength range of data for a given
fit. You can set the range of data of interest before using the
`peakfit` function, or you can use the arguments `wlgth.min` and
`wlgth.max` for setting up the wavelength range. Note that you can give
a value to one or both of the arguments.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
Ba455_fit <- corrected_spec %>% 
  peakfit(profile = "Gaussian", wG = 1, A =  15000, wlgth.min = 454.09, wlgth.max = 457.09)
```

```{r}
Ca422_fit <- corrected_spec %>% 
  peakfit(profile = "Gaussian", wG = 1, A = 15000, wlgth.min = 421.65, wlgth.max = 424.30)
```

After a successful fit, you can get a variety of results such as the
location of the peak, the height, the area and FWHM for each peak, as
well as the basic fitted coefficients and estimates of errors for each
quantity. The `peakfit` function returns a list containing data stored
in `augmented` and in `tidied`. For instance, using results from the Ba
line fitting, we can see that `augmented` contains the original data `x`
(wavelength) and `y` (intensity) and the fitted results `.fitted` along
with the corresponding residuals `.resid`.

```{r}
Ba455_fit %>% pluck("augmented")
```

While `tidied` contains the estimated parameters (FWHM, peak height, and
area for fitted peak).

```{r}
Ba455_fit %>% pluck("tidied")
```

Thus, using the `plotFit` function, we can plot the obtained results,
since a picture is worth a thousand words. Individual peaks, the overall
fit and baseline are included on the plot. The residuals plot (at the
bottom) is very handy in deciding whether the fit is good or whether
there may be additional peaks lurking in the data. In the result shown
below the residuals are just noise indicating a good fit.

```{r}
plotFit(data = Ba455_fit, title = "Ba II 455.40 nm") | 
  plotFit(data = Ca422_fit, title = "Ca I 422.67 nm")
```

In fact, we should rather look at the Voigt profile, especially if we
want to have an accurate measurement of the FWHM of the emission lines.
Notwithstanding self-absorption effect, the Lorentzian FWHM, `wL`,
estimate provides the broadening of the spectral lines while the
Gaussian FWHM, `wG`, estimate provides the instrumental broadening.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
Ba455_fit2 <- corrected_spec %>% 
  peakfit(profile = "Voigt", wL = 0.1, wG = 0.9, A =  15000, wlgth.min = 454.09, wlgth.max = 457.09)
```

```{r}
Ca422_fit2 <- corrected_spec %>% 
  peakfit(profile = "Voigt", wL = 0.1, wG = 0.9, A = 15000, wlgth.min = 421.65, wlgth.max = 424.30)
```

```{r}
Ba455_fit2 %>% pluck("tidied")
```

```{r}
plotFit(data = Ba455_fit2, title = "Ba II 455.40 nm") | 
  plotFit(data = Ca422_fit2, title = "Ca I 422.67 nm")
```

We can statistically compare (p-value) the results obtained with the
Gaussian profile with those obtained with the pseudo-Voigt profile, to decide which of these lineshape functions gives the best estimate of FWHM of the spectral line. Or we can calculate the $k$ parameter which describes the
"Gaussness" or "Lorentzness" of a Voigt profile. A value of 0 means a
pure Lorentzian profile and of 1 means a pure Gaussian profile. $k$ is
given by the following expression:

<p align="center">
<img src="images/MixingParam-01.png" width="129"/>
</p>

As expected, both methods show that Gaussian broadening accounts for
most of the observed broadening of the 455.50 nm Ba II emission line.

### Multiple peaks fitting

On the other hand, it may sometimes be more advisable to fit multiple 
peaks at the same time, especially when they overlap. The `multipeakfit` 
function has as input a vector of peaks center, `peaks`,  and a vector of lineshape functions associated with each of the peaks, `profiles`. It worth noting that you can fit all peaks with a same fitting function or fit each peak with a different function. In the example below, three spectral lines, Ca II 393.37 nm, Ca II 396.85 nm and Mn I 403-nm were fitted using the Gaussian profile.

```{r}
mfit <- corrected_spec %>%
  multipeakfit(
    peaks = c(393.37, 396.85, 403.31), 
    profiles = c("Gaussian", "Gaussian", "Gaussian"), 
    wG = c(1, 1, 1), 
    A = c(15000, 8000, 10000), 
    wlgth.min = 392.0, wlgth.max = 405.5
    )
```

```{r}
mfit
```

#### Exemple

Before going any further, we are going to give here a typical example in which we want to fit the Ca II 315.92 nm and Ca II 317.96 nm emission lines. These spectral lines were acquired from a hundred samples, and were identified by a unique name associated with each of the samples.

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
data("cranbSpec")
```

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
bc_cranbSpec <- cranbSpec %>%
  baselinerm(degree = 7) %>%
  pluck("spec") %>%
  bind_cols(select(cranbSpec, spectra_id), .)
```

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
bc_cranbSpec %>% plotSpec(id = "spectra_id")
```
